        <img src = "ROAD.JPEG" align = "left" alt = "Offroad spot near my house" /> <p>This is an offraoding trail near my home in Virginia. I enjoy going here to drive around with friends. The place gets muddy easily which makes it a messy adventure after a rain. I have been to this place as a driver and a passenger. Both are fun!</p>

        <p>Here is my favorite restaurant</p>

        <p>No one expects that I can do a one-and-a-half flip off of a diving board.</p>
